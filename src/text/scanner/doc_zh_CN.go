// Package scanner provides a scanner and tokenizer for UTF-8-encoded text.
// It takes an io.Reader providing the source, which then can be tokenized
// through repeated calls to the Scan function.  For compatibility with
// existing tools, the NUL character is not allowed. If the first character
// in the source is a UTF-8 encoded byte order mark (BOM), it is discarded.
//
// By default, a Scanner skips white space and Go comments and recognizes all
// literals as defined by the Go language specification.  It may be
// customized to recognize only a subset of those literals and to recognize
// different identifier and white space characters.
